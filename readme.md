### WordPress MVC Plugin Boilerplate

#### A WordPress plugin boilerplate made with PS4 autoloading and MVC design pattern in mind. 

Original boilerplate code was made with https://wppb.me/, but changes made to accommodate MVC design pattern and PSR4 autoloading. Some additional tools for WordPress, PHP and JS development were added.

There might be more replacements to be done to get all dummy text changed but I've tried to list all of them below. Feel free to submit a pull request for any changes.

Replacements:

- Add relevant info to package.json

Exact match replacements (case sensitive):

- Replace 'our_plugin_name' with Plugin name
- Replace 'text-domain' with plugin text domain
- Replace 'PREFIX' with a prefix for constants
- Replace 'prefix' with a lowercase version of the plugin name example wcdpue, prefix etc
- Replace 'root' in file name for activator and deactivator with a lowercase version of the plugin name example wcdpue, prefix etc
- Replace 'Root' with a shortname for plugin example Wcdpue, Root etc 
- Replace 'author' with plugin author name,
- Replace 'author_url' with author website,
- Replace 'author_email' with author email address
